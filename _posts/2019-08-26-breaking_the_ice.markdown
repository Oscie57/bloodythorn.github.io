Welcome to the Game Lexicon. This bvlog focuses on terminology in and around Games, Video Games in particular, and terms used in game development.

We will look at terminology in game design describing aspects of software, graphic, and sound design as well as developing the underlying data models.

Our language is constantly evolving with the world around us. Every generation is greeted with a host of new terms as well as the redefinition of old ones.

Game development is no exception.

Each bvlog will focus around a concept and look at how that concept came about and evolved into what we know of it today.

Hopefully by reading or watching this bvlog, you will come away with a clearer definition of what these terms describe, but not always.

Evolving language isn't always clear. Terms often evolve to where previous generations can no longer understand new terminology. In some cases they might flip flop entirely.

[Visual] : Typography of words that have had confounding effects on subsequent generations.

As for myself, I'm Thom, and I've been in the computer industry for decades and an avid gamer well longer. Pong was my introduction into computer gaming, and I've been hooked ever since.

These terms will be deconstructed from the perspective of a game enthusiast, programmer, computer science graduate, IT industry veteran, hobby linguist and nearly a half-century of experience with computers and computer games.
