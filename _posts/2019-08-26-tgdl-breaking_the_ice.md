Welcome to the Game Lexicon. This blog focuses on terminology in and around Games, Video Games in particular, and terms used in game development. We plan to mirror this blog in video form on our youtube channel.

We will look at terminology in game design describing aspects of software, graphic, and sound design as well as developing the underlying data models.

Our language is constantly evolving with the world around us. Every generation is greeted with a host of new terms as well as the redefinition of old ones. Game development is no exception.

Each bvlog will focus around a concept and look at how that concept came about and evolved into what we know of it today. Hopefully by reading or watching this bvlog, you will come away with a clearer definition of what these terms describe, but not always.

Evolving language isn't always clear. Terms often evolve to where previous generations can no longer understand new terminology. In some cases they might flip flop entirely.

As for myself, I'm Thom, and I've been in the computer industry for decades and an avid gamer well longer. Pong was my introduction into computer gaming, and I've been hooked ever since.

These terms will be deconstructed from the perspective of a game enthusiast, programmer, computer science graduate, IT industry veteran, hobby linguist and nearly a half-century of experience with computers and computer games.

And who are you? Our content targets those who are interested in the technicals behind game development, but have yet to invest enough time to learn fundamental terminology.

Our technical explanations aim to define common terms in example before they are used regularly. So if you are familiar with programming or computer architecture, you might require something more technical.

I truly believe that video games are the next evolution in artistic mediums. The next 'photography' or 'moving picture', so to speak. So if you like to express yourself artistically and video games pique your interest then our content is for you.
