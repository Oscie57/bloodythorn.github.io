### WiiHacks the Wiki

I maintain the [WiiHacks Wiki](http://www.wiihacks.org/main_page) a maintained repository for the knowledge of the subreddit.

### WiiHacky the WiiHacks Bot

I'm also currently coding a bot for moderation in the subreddit in Python with Discord integration. Meet [WiiHacky](https://github.com/bloodythorn/wiihacky) the WiiHacks bot.

### Roguelikes and MUDs

I'm also typically noodling in my current language trying to solidify my vision of a game. Stay tuned on more information on that.
