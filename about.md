My name is Thom Green and I am an IT professional and programmer. I have a bachelors of science in computer science and over twenty years
of experience in the IT industry working for or by proxy for
companies such as Compaq, Best Buy, Gateway, USPS, Microsoft, Nortel,
Unisys, and AT&T.

I've had a short stint as a professional musician, and still retain music as one of my primary hobbies as well as a strong interest in art in general. I help moderate a community for hacking and modifying retro game consoles (the Nintendo Wii) and am slowly piecing together enough to get started with UAVs.
