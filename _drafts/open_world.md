  Gamepedia:
    Open-world video games are a type of video game where a player can roam freely through a virtual world and is given considerable freedom in choosing how or when to approach objectives.[1] 
    Free roam
    Sandbox
    But the most common usage of "open world" refers to a game that features free-roaming outdoor exploration across a large game world that is fully-scaled and continuous.

  I think it's a game that gives you an avatar, puts you in an environment, and gameplay is based on what you can do in that environment, not on a specified goal.

## notes from wikipedia

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world

In video games, an open world is a virtual world in which the player can explore and approach objectives freely, as opposed to a world with more linear gameplay.[1][2] While games have used open-world designs since the 1980s, the implementation in Grand Theft Auto III (2001) set a standard that has been used since.[3]

free-roaming worlds typically lack the invisible walls and loading screens common in linear level designs

high level of autonomy in computer games can be found in massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG) or in single-player games adhering to the open world concept such as the Fallout series.

A major design challenge is to balance the freedom of an open world with the structure of a dramatic storyline.

Since players may perform actions that the game designer did not expect,[10] the game's writers must find creative ways to impose a storyline on the player without interfering with their freedom

Gameplay designer Manveer Heir, who worked on Mass Effect 3 and Mass Effect Andromeda for Electronic Arts, said that there are difficulties in the design of an open-world game since it is difficult to predict how players will approach solving gameplay challenges offered by a design, in contrast to a linear progression, and needs to be a factor in the game's development from its onset. Heir opined that some of the critical failings of Andromeda were due to the open world being added late in development

In an op-ed piece for BBC News, David Braben, co-creator of Elite, called truly open-ended game design "The Holy Grail" of modern video gaming, citing games like Elite and the Grand Theft Auto series as early steps in that direction.[13] Peter Molyneux has also stated that he believes emergence (or emergent gameplay) is where video game development is headed in the future

-> Is this true? I mean, there are other kinds of video games.

 Ars Technica traces the concept back to the free-roaming exploration of 1976 text adventure game Colossal Cave Adventure,[24] which inspired the free-roaming exploration of Adventure (1980),[25][26] but notes that it wasn't until 1984 that what "we now know as open-world gaming" took on a "definite shape" with 1984 space simulator Elite,[27] considered a pioneer of the open world;[28][29][30][31] Gamasutra argues that its open-ended sandbox style is rooted in flight simulators, such as SubLOGIC's Flight Simulator (1979/1980), noting most flight sims "offer a 'free flight' mode that allows players to simply pilot the aircraft and explore the virtual world".[29] Others trace the concept back to 1981 CRPG Ultima,[32][33][34] which had a free-roaming overworld map inspired by tabletop RPG Dungeons & Dragons.[27] The overworld maps of the first five Ultima games, released up to 1988, lacked a single, unified scale, with towns and other places represented as icons;[27] this style was adopted by the first three Dragon Quest games, released from 1986 to 1988 in Japan.[35][4]

Early examples of open-world gameplay in adventure games include The Portopia Serial Murder Case (1983)[36][37] and The Lords of Midnight (1984),[38] with open-world elements also found in The Hobbit (1982)[39] and Valhalla (1983).[40] The strategy video game, The Seven Cities of Gold (1984), is also cited as an early open-world game,[41][42][43] influencing Sid Meier's Pirates! (1987).[41] Eurogamer also cites British computer games such as Ant Attack (1983) and Sabre Wulf (1984) as early examples.[30] 

According to The Escapist, The Legend of Zelda was an early example of open-world, nonlinear gameplay, with an expansive and cohesive world

Grand Theft Auto has had over 200 million sales.[70] Creative director Gary Penn, who previously worked on Frontier: Elite II, cited Elite as a key influence, calling it "basically Elite in a city", and mentioned other team members being influenced by Syndicate and Mercenary.[71]

Grand Theft Auto III combined elements from previous games, and fused them together into a new immersive 3D experience that helped define open-world games for a new generation. Executive producer Sam Houser described it as "Zelda meets Goodfellas",[72] while producer Dan Houser also cited The Legend of Zelda and Super Mario 64 as influences.

No Man's Sky, released in 2016, is an open-world game set in a virtually infinite universe. According to the developers, through procedural generation, the game is able to produce more than 18 quintillion (18*10^15 or 18,000,000,000,000,000) planets to explore.[81] Several critics found that the nature of the game can become repetitive and monotonous, with the survival gameplay elements being lackluster and tedious. Jake Swearingen in New York said, "You can procedurally generate 18.6 quintillion unique planets, but you can’t procedurally generate 18.6 quintillion unique things to do."[82] Subsequent updates made post-release have since aimed to address these criticisms.
